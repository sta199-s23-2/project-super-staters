It was also a collaboration between the Echo Nest and LabROSA (laboratory working towards intelligent machine listening). It was collected in 2011.\nWrite a brief description of the observations.\nA brief description of the observations in this data set is that there are 10,000 observations with different songs associated by a song ID and their respective artists that also have an artist ID."

However, one per data set is required.)\nHow does the relationship between tempo and song popularity differ by the genre associated with the artist (artist.terms)?\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nWe will take a look at the relationship between the tempos of songs and their popularity by four specific genres (rap, techno, country, rock) associated with the artists. After looking into this relationship, we will be able to establish if certain genres are more or less popular due to faster or slower tempos. We predict that rock and techno songs will have a strong positive relationship between tempo and popularity and that rap and country will still have a positive relationship, but not a strong one.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\nThe categorical variable is genre associated with artist (artist.terms). The quantitative variables are tempo and popularity."

This paper uses a dataset of 1000 songs to investigate this question. Ultimately, the researchers find that there is only a fairly limited relation between song popularity (measured in stream count) and song features. In particular, the paper finds that tempo, which is the variable that we are most interested in, has no significant relation to stream count.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nOur research question builds on this article because we are similarly looking into audio features (like tempo) that make songs more popular but going further to see if a relation can be found conditional upon the genre (not an audio feature) associated with the artist a song."

David, explores the role of movie stars in reducing uncertainty in the movie industry. The authors examine the relationship between the presence of “stars” or A-List actors in movies, and their box office performance. Their findings are that star power can reduce the uncertainty associated with box office success, but only up to a certain point - their ability to influence a film’s performance in the box office is limited. The study also highlights the importance of other factors such as genre, quality, and marketing in determining box office success. Overall, the paper provides insights into the complex nature of the movie industry and the factors that influence moviegoers’ decision-making.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nWhile the article examines how factors of a movie can impact its sales success in the box office, our data and research question are concerned with video games.

    "text": "Introduction and data\nThe source of this data is the Million Song Dataset. The National Science Foundation’s project IIS-0713334 funded the Million Song Dataset with a grant. There were several curators for this dataset; the Million Song Dataset used a company called the Echo Nest to derive global data points about one million contemporary songs. It was also a collaboration between the Echo Nest and LabROSA (laboratory working towards intelligent machine listening). It was collected in 2011. There are 10,000 observations with different songs associated by a song ID and their respective artists that also have an artist ID. Every observation is also defined by several variables such as artist familiarity, song loudness, song tempo, and many more. It is important to note that there are no audios in this dataset, only the derived features.\nPrevious literature exists about the topic. “Prediction of product success: explaining song popularity by audio features from Spotify data” attempts to explore the relation between song attributes such as tempo and key signature, as well as the number of plays on Spotify, the popular music-streaming platform. This paper uses a dataset of 1000 songs to investigate this question. Ultimately, the researchers find that there is only a fairly limited relation between song popularity (measured in stream count) and song features. In particular, the paper finds that tempo, which is the variable that we are most interested in, has no significant relation to stream count. Our research question builds on this article because we are similarly looking into audio features (like tempo) that make songs more popular but going further to see if a relation can be found conditional upon the genre (not an audio feature) associated with the artist a song.\nNijkamp, R. (2018). Prediction of product success: explaining song popularity by audio features from Spotify data (Bachelor’s thesis, University of Twente). http://essay.utwente.nl/75422/1/NIJKAMP_BA_IBA.pdf\nResearch Question\nGiven a genre (Rock, Pop, Rap, or Country, chosen for their sizable amount of observations within the data set), associated with an artist (artist.terms), how are the relationships between different song attributes (such as song.tempo, song.duration, artist.familiarity, song.year) related to song popularity (song.hotttnesss)? Do these relations differ for artists associated with different genres?\nMethodology\nWe first load our data.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   1.0.0 \n✔ tibble  3.1.8      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\n── Attaching packages ────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels 1.0.0 ──\n✔ broom        1.0.2     ✔ rsample      1.1.1\n✔ dials        1.1.0     ✔ tune         1.0.1\n✔ infer        1.0.4     ✔ workflows    1.1.2\n✔ modeldata    1.0.1     ✔ workflowsets 1.0.0\n✔ parsnip      1.0.3     ✔ yardstick    1.1.0\n✔ recipes      1.0.3     \n── Conflicts ───────────────────────────────────────── tidymodels_conflicts() ──\n✖ scales::discard() masks purrr::discard()\n✖ dplyr::filter()   masks stats::filter()\n✖ recipes::fixed()  masks stringr::fixed()\n✖ dplyr::lag()      masks stats::lag()\n✖ yardstick::spec() masks readr::spec()\n✖ recipes::step()   masks stats::step()\n• Dig deeper into tidy modeling with R at https://www.tmwr.org\n\nmusic <- read_csv(\"data/music.csv\")\n\nRows: 10000 Columns: 35\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (4): artist.id, artist.name, artist.terms, song.id\ndbl (31): artist.familiarity, artist.hotttnesss, artist.latitude, artist.loc...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nmusic_filter <- music |>\n  filter(str_detect(artist.terms, \"rock\") |\n         str_detect(artist.terms, \"rap\") |\n         str_detect(artist.terms, \"pop\") |\n         str_detect(artist.terms, \"country\"))\n\nmusic_filter$rock_genre <- if_else(\n  grepl(\"rock\", music_filter$artist.terms), \n        \"rock\", \"not rock\")\n\nmusic_filter$rap_genre <- if_else(\n  grepl(\"rap\", music_filter$artist.terms), \n        \"rap\", \"not rap\")\n\nmusic_filter$pop_genre <- if_else(\n  grepl(\"pop\", music_filter$artist.terms), \n        \"pop\", \"not pop\")\n\nmusic_filter$country_genre <- if_else(\n  grepl(\"country\", music_filter$artist.terms), \n        \"country\", \"not country\")\n\nmusic_filter <- music_filter |>\n  mutate(artist.terms = if_else(rock_genre == \"rock\", \"Rock\",\n                        if_else(rap_genre == \"rap\", \"Rap\",\n                        if_else(pop_genre == \"pop\", \"Pop\",\n                        if_else(country_genre == \"country\", \"Country\", \"\")))))\n\nNext, we plot linear regressions visually over a scatterplot to show the relation between four different song attributes (listed in our research question) and song popularity by our four genres of interest. We do this to get a general sense of how the song attributes might predict song popularity, which will help us answer our research question of how much each song attribute is correlated with a song’s popularity.\n\nmusic_filter |> \n  filter(song.hotttnesss >= 0) |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = song.tempo, y = song.hotttnesss)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F) +\n  facet_wrap(~ artist.terms) +\n  labs(x = \"Tempo (BPM)\", y = \"Song popularity (rated from 0-1)\",\n       title = \"The Relationship Between Song Tempo\n       and Popularity by Genre\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmusic_filter |> \n  filter(song.hotttnesss >= 0,\n         song.duration < 1000) |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = song.duration, y = song.hotttnesss)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F) +\n  facet_wrap(~ artist.terms) +\n  labs(x = \"Duration (seconds)\", y = \"Song popularity (rated from 0-1)\",\n       title = \"The Relationship Between Song Duration\n       and Popularity by Genre\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmusic_filter |> \n  filter(song.hotttnesss >= 0) |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = artist.familiarity, y = song.hotttnesss)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F) +\n  facet_wrap(~ artist.terms) +\n  labs(x = \"Familiarity (0-1 scale)\", y = \"Song popularity (rated from 0-1)\",\n       title = \"The Relationship Between Song Duration\n       and Popularity by Genre\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmusic_filter |> \n  filter(song.hotttnesss >= 0,\n         song.year > 0) |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = song.year, y = song.hotttnesss)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F) +\n  facet_wrap(~ artist.terms) +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"Song popularity (rated from 0-1)\",\n       title = \"The Relationship Between Song Duration\n       and Popularity by Genre\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we run interactive regression models to measure the interactive effect between artist.terms (genre associated with an artist) and respective song attributes on song popularity (song.hotttnesss). We believe that an interactive model is useful in answering our research question because we are interested in the extent to which different song attributes predict song popularity, based on the genre associated with the artist. The predictions made by our interactive model can thus be broken down into the different predicted effects for each genre, which directly helps us answer our research question. Additionally, we are able to calculate the AIC and adjusted R-squared value of each model to determine which model is the greatest fit, and thus which may possibly have the most significant predictve power, which will also help us answer our question of the extent to which different song attributes predict song popularity.\nPop: \\(\\widehat{song.hotttness} = -0.370642967 + -0.215690672 *
