However, one per data set is required.)\nHow does the relationship between tempo and song popularity differ by the genre associated with the artist (artist.terms)?\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nWe will take a look at the relationship between the tempos of songs and their popularity by four specific genres (rap, techno, country, rock) associated with the artists. After looking into this relationship, we will be able to establish if certain genres are more or less popular due to faster or slower tempos. We predict that rock and techno songs will have a strong positive relationship between tempo and popularity and that rap and country will still have a positive relationship, but not a strong one.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?The categorical variable is genre associated with artist (artist.terms). The quantitative variables are tempo and popularity."

Prediction of product success: explaining song popularity by audio features from Spotify data (Bachelor’s thesis, University of Twente). http://essay.utwente.nl/75422/1/NIJKAMP_BA_IBA.pdf\nProvide a one paragraph summary about the article.\nPrediction of product success: explaining song popularity by audio features from Spotify data attempts to explore the relation between song attributes such as tempo and key signature, as well as the number of plays on Spotify, the popular music-streaming platform. This paper uses a dataset of 1000 songs to investigate this question. Ultimately, the researchers find that there is only a fairly limited relation between song popularity (measured in stream count) and song features. In particular, the paper finds that tempo, which is the variable that we are most interested in, has no significant relation to stream count.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nOur research question builds on this article because we are similarly looking into audio features (like tempo) that make songs more popular but going further to see if a relation can be found conditional upon the genre (not an audio feature) associated with the artist a song."
