It was also a collaboration between the Echo Nest and LabROSA (laboratory working towards intelligent machine listening). It was collected in 2011.\nWrite a brief description of the observations.\nA brief description of the observations in this data set is that there are 10,000 observations with different songs associated by a song ID and their respective artists that also have an artist ID."

However, one per data set is required.)\nHow does the relationship between tempo and song popularity differ by the genre associated with the artist (artist.terms)?\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\nWe will take a look at the relationship between the tempos of songs and their popularity by four specific genres (rap, techno, country, rock) associated with the artists. After looking into this relationship, we will be able to establish if certain genres are more or less popular due to faster or slower tempos. We predict that rock and techno songs will have a strong positive relationship between tempo and popularity and that rap and country will still have a positive relationship, but not a strong one.\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\nThe categorical variable is genre associated with artist (artist.terms). The quantitative variables are tempo and popularity."

This paper uses a dataset of 1000 songs to investigate this question. Ultimately, the researchers find that there is only a fairly limited relation between song popularity (measured in stream count) and song features. In particular, the paper finds that tempo, which is the variable that we are most interested in, has no significant relation to stream count.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nOur research question builds on this article because we are similarly looking into audio features (like tempo) that make songs more popular but going further to see if a relation can be found conditional upon the genre (not an audio feature) associated with the artist a song."

David, explores the role of movie stars in reducing uncertainty in the movie industry. The authors examine the relationship between the presence of “stars” or A-List actors in movies, and their box office performance. Their findings are that star power can reduce the uncertainty associated with box office success, but only up to a certain point - their ability to influence a film’s performance in the box office is limited. The study also highlights the importance of other factors such as genre, quality, and marketing in determining box office success. Overall, the paper provides insights into the complex nature of the movie industry and the factors that influence moviegoers’ decision-making.\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\nWhile the article examines how factors of a movie can impact its sales success in the box office, our data and research question are concerned with video games.

    "text": "The source of this data is the Million Song Dataset. The National Science Foundation’s project IIS-0713334 funded the Million Song Dataset with a grant. There were several curators for this dataset---the Million Song Dataset used a company called the Echo Nest to derive global data points about one million contemporary songs. It was also a collaboration between the Echo Nest and LabROSA (laboratory working towards intelligent machine listening). It was collected in 2011. There are 10,000 observations with different songs associated by a song ID and their respective artists that also have an artist ID. Every observation is also defined by several variables such as artist familiarity, song loudness, song tempo, and many more. It is important to note that there are no audios in this dataset, only the derived features."
